        Sailing stones (also called sliding rocks, walking rocks, rolling stones, and moving rocks) are part of the
        geological phenomenon in which rocks move and inscribe long tracks along a smooth valley floor without animal
        intervention. The movement of the rocks occurs when large, thin sheets of ice floating on an ephemeral winter
        pond move and break up due to wind. Trails of sliding rocks have been observed and studied in various locations,
        including Little Bonnie Claire Playa, in Nevada,[1] and most famously at Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National
        Park, California, where the number and length of tracks are notable.

        Tracks are sometimes non-linear.
        The Racetrack's stones speckle the playa floor, predominantly in the southern portion. Historical accounts
        identify some stones around 100 m (330 ft) from shore, yet most of the stones are found relatively close to
        their respective originating outcrops. Three lithologic types are identified:
